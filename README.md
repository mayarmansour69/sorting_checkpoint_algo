sorting and searching algorithm checkpoint

Initialization: Declare variables and input the array of unsorted cards.
Sorting Loop: Iterate through each card in the array.
For each card, compare it with the sorted sequence on the left.
Insert the card into its correct position in the sorted sequence.
Output: Display the sorted array of cards.
This algorithm sorts the array of cards by iteratively inserting each card into its correct position in the sorted sequence, mimicking how we sort playing cards in our hands.
